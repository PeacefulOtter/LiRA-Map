# LiRA-Map

This repository contains the code for the LiRA Map web application in the context of the LiRA project. This specific branch is meant to give access to the content of my thesis "Understanding Road Condition and Car Data: A Flexible Framework for the Visualization of Spatio-Temporal Data". This web application has been developed in collaboration with Nathan Maire.

The main parts concerning my thesis are under the folder client/src/Components/CarData. In that path the code related to the frontend react app can be found.

The back-end NestJS server can be found in folder server-nest/
